This critical energy threshold indicates when power hits its limit for that location. You will be shown the energy grid consumption for more than one location. Each graph shows energy consumption for one location.

 

Task: Your job is to look at the graphs and answer 360 same multiple choice questions about energy consumption at various locations. To respond to the questions, you would need to pick one of the options below each graph. When you are done with each question, click the next button to continue.
